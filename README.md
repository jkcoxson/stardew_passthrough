# stardew_passthrough
A proxy for Stardew Valley

## Usage
``./stardew_passthrough target_ip``

## Inspiration
I have a server running a VPN. To connect to games accross the VPN, it was easier to program a UDP proxy than to fight with iptables.

## Background
Stardew Valley uses port 24642. Using a method like this it could be possible to reverse engineer the Stardew Valley protocol for use in more projects.
